We propose a two-level hierarchical framework for safe reinforcement learning in a complex environment. The high-level part is an adaptive planner, which aims at learning and generating safe and efficient paths for tasks with imperfect map information. The lower-level part contains a learning-based controller and its corresponding neural Lyapunov function, which characterizes the controllerâ€™s stability property. This learned neural Lyapunov function serves two purposes. First, it will be part of the high-level heuristic for our planning algorithm. Second, it acts as a part of a runtime shield to guard the safety of the whole system. We use a robot navigation example to demonstrate that our framework can operate efficiently and safely in complex environments, even under adversarial attacks.
