title: "[WIP} Active Graph Anomaly Detection"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/gad
excerpt: 'We are exploring how to find anomalies in graph data using active learning, generative models and bi-level optimization. Given a graph with nodes, node attributes, edges and an oracle, we will try to learn a strong enough autoencoder that can learn the distinction between anomalous and benign nodes. Similar to real life, we do not have labels, but we have a human annotator who can make an educated guess for the label. From the human annotator, we will receive the label and their confidence (percentage) – we claim that we can use the soft label to learn highly accurate hard labels.'
