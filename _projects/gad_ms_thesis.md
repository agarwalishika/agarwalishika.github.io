title: "[Master's Thesis] Active Graph Anomaly Detection"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/gad_ms_thesis
excerpt: 'Recently, detecting anomalies in attributed networks has gained a lot of attention from research communities due to the numerous real-world use cases in the financial, social media, medical, and agricultural domains. This thesis aims to explore node anomaly detection in two different aspects: soft-labeling, and multi-armed bandits. The environment in both settings is constrained to an active learning scenario where there is no direct access to ground truth labels but access to an oracle. This thesis comprises of three works: one using soft-labeling, another with multi-armed bandits, and a third that explores a combination of both. We present experimental results for each work to justify the algorithmic decisions that were made. Future work is also discussed to build on top of these methods.'
