I am a PhD student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently working with [Dr. Dilek Hakkani-Tur](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek) and [Dr. Gokhan Tur](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/gokhan).

Research interests:
Currently, I'm interested in **data efficiency in NLP** - from uncertainty estimation to active learning and subset/coreset selection. I've worked in LLM-based agents, reinforcement learning, and graph machine learning.

Highlights:
- I'm heading to Miami for EMNLP 2024 - email/DM me on Twitter to meet up :)
- [TreeInstruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11709) was accepted at EMNLP 2024!
- Interned at IBM Research as a Research Scientist Intern in Summer 2024
- Graduated from MSCS at UIUC in May 2024 (advised by [Dr. Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/))
- Graudated from BS CS at Purdue in May 2022
