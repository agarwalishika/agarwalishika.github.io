I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently working with [Dr. Dilek Hakkani-Tur](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek) and [Dr. Gokhan Tur](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/gokhan).

Research interests: Currently, I'm interested in **data efficiency in NLP** - from uncertainty estimation to active learning and subset/coreset selection. I'm starting to broaden my interests in **data centric NLP**. I've worked in LLM-based agents, reinforcement learning, and graph machine learning. I've also been recently interested in multilinguality in LLMs.
